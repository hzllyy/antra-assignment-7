1. What’s the purpose of using the key attribute when we render a list of items in JSX?

2. What is a  “children” props?
A: Children props are special props that allow parent components to render whatever is nested inside of them.


3. What is pure function and pure component?
A: A pure function is a function that does not change its inputs and outputs, and does not change any objects or variables that exist before they are called.


4. What is conditional rendering? How do you implement it effectively?
